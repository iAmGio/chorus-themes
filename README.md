## How to submit a theme
1. Follow [these](https://github.com/iAmGio/chorus#creating-your-own-theme) steps to create your own theme.
2. In your theme folder, add a file named CREDITS.txt to claim the theme as yours. This file can contain your name, your site, your GitHub link, etc.
3. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/iAmGio/chorus-themes/pulls) containing the folder **only** or send it via Telegram to [@iAmGio_O](https://t.me/iAmGio_O). 

The theme will be tested and, if appropriate, will be accepted and merged in this repository.
